<b>HTML Structure:</b>

The game board consists of a grid of nine div elements, each representing a cell. These cells are dynamically managed using JavaScript.
A status display (#statusText) updates the playerâ€™s turn, winner, or a draw message.
A "Restart" button (#restartBtn) resets the game.

<b>CSS Styling:</b>

The .cell class styles each cell with a fixed size, border, and center-aligned text.
The #cellContainer uses a CSS grid layout for the 3x3 board, while the container centers the game visually.


<b>Initialization: </b>

Restart Functionality: Resets all variables and clears the board.
